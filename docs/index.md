Plasmid is a library for creating server-side minigames with Fabric.
Plasmid intends to do all the boring work relating to minigame implementation, to rather allow focus effort on just the game itself.

This website serves as documentation for the library so that it can be used by anyone, anywhere.

If you'd like, you can find many examples of games implemented with Plasmid on the [Nucleoid Organisation](https://github.com/NucleoidMC), or even join and play them on our Minecraft server at `nucleoid.xyz`.

You can also find us on our [Discord](https://nucleoid.xyz/discord) if you have any troubles or queries, or would like to get involved.
